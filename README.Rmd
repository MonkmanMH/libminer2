The goal of libminer2 is to provide a summary of a user's R libraries. It's a toy package developed in a workshop taught by Andy Teucher on 2023-08-03.

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MonkmanMH/libminer2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(libminer2)
## basic example code

lib_summary()

# you can also ask it to calculate the sizes 

lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
